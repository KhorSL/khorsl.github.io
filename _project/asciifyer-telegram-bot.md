## About ASCIIFYER

A bot implementation of the [ASCII-ART python](https://github.com/KhorSL/ASCII-ART) script I wrote. The bot serve a simple purpose that is to convert a given image to a ASCII image.

The underlying algorithm is pretty straightforward.
1. Resize the image to a standard size.
2. Convert to image to grayscale.
3. Map each of the grayscale pixel to an ASCII character.
4. Process the ASCII text into an image file.

## Programming Languages
