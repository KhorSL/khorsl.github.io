I am a final year student in School of Computing at National University of Singapore. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Computing (Computer Science) specializing in Database Systems. This summer break I am doing an internship with Wego as a backend Software Engineer. I am currently creating an API microservice for a new mobile feature that will allow users to browse blog posts curated by the editorial team. Through this internship I have found my passion in software engineering and aspire to continue enhance my skills to develop solutions that will bring great impact.
